# Quick and Easy Vercel Deployment Workflow

You can have this project entirely hosted on Vercel with the real time feature.

Do the following:

1. Create either Upstash or Redis database from the storage tab.

2. Create a Supabase or Prisma database from the storage tab.

3. Grab your `.env` keys and drop it in `.env`, verify workflow is good to go and you can just connect and push.

4. Add a new project, and, use a fork of this project as the endpoint.

If you need [Github](./GITHUB.md) or [Google](./GOOGLE.md) SSO, just review the docs.
